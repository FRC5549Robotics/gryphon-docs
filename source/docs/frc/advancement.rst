Competition Advancement
========================

Included in the registration fee paid each team is the opportunity to attend a competition. Teams based in regions that use district system can attend two district competitions. Other teams can only attend one regional competition. Teams can attend additional competitions if they pay more money. 

.. note:: Team 5549 is based in the Chesapeake, or CHS, region. As CHS follows the district system, our team has the opportunity to attend two competitions.

Regions following Regional System
----------------------------------

Depending on the performance of teams at a regional event, they have the opportunity to advance to worlds. According to the 2020 rulebook, only Regional Chairman's Award winners, FIRST Engineering Inspiration Award winners, Regional competition winners, and Wild Card recipients can proceed to the FIRST championship event, or worlds. Wild cards are distributed to the finalist alliance in the order of team selection.

Regions following the District Model
------------------------------------

For regions that follow district model, teams are given a certain amount of points depending on their competition performance. Points are gained based on qualification rank, alliance selection, playoff performance, and awards. For the full details, view the rulebook. 

Based on the points obtained during the two district competitions, teams can qualify for district champs. For 2020, the top 80 teams in district points would have qualified for district champs. Depending on the performance of the team at district champs, they can progress to the FIRST Championship event, or worlds.
