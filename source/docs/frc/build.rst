Build Season
============

To prevent teams from gaining an unfair advantage, FIRST does not allow teams to begin constructing until the release of the rulebook. Due to this rule, the robot should be built in the time between the release of the rulebook and a team's first competition. This period is referred to as "build season".

.. note:: Prior to 2020, teams only had six weeks to complete their robots. Once that six week period had ended, the robot must stop building. For 2020 and later, that rule no longer exists. There is no restriction on the time that teams can work on their robots.
