Overview
========

The First Robotics Competition, often abbreviated to FRC, is a high school robotics competition. Each team works to build the robot that best accomplishes the tasks of the game. 

FIRST
-----

For Inspiration and Reognition of Science and Technology, or more commonly known as FIRST, is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization focused on inspiring students and youth in STEM. They organize multiple competitions, each aimed at various age groups. As of 2021, FIRST runs the following programs:

* FIRST LEGO League Discover (Pre-K to Grade 1)
* FIRST LEGO League Explore (Grade 2 to Grade 4)
* FIRST LEGO League Challenge (Grade 4 to Grade 8)
* FIRST Tech Challenge (Grade 7 to Grade 12)
* FIRST Robotics Competition (Grade 9 to Grade 12)

Games and Rules
---------------

Every year, a new game is released. Each game has its own set of objectives. For example, robots during the 2020 game Infinite Recharge shot foam balls to score while robots moved panels and yoga balls in the 2019 game Deep Space.

.. note:: Due to COVID-19, FIRST did not release a new game in 2021.

The new game is usually revealed during the first Saturday of January. The rulebook, a 100+ document, containts all of the game details, including dimensions and scoring methods. As the games are quite different from year to year, a new robot is build each year. To save money though, certain components are often reused.
