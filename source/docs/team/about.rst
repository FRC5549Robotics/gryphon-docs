About
=====

We are Gryphon Robotics, a student-run robotics club based out of George C. Marshall High School. We build robots throughout the year and participate in the :doc:`FIRST Robotics Competition </docs/frc/overview>`. 

Mission Statement
-----------------

Our goal at Gryphon Robotics is to inspire students in a multitude of learning pursuits including leadership, project management, engineering, cooperation, and business skills. We prepare students for technical and STEM related careers by offering the opportunity for hands-on development of practical skills that they will take with them for the rest of their lives.
