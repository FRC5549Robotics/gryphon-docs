FIRST Robotics Competition
==========================

The First Robotics Competition, often abbreviated to FRC, is a high school robotics competition. Each team works to build the robot that best accomplishes the tasks of the game. 

FIRST
-----

For Inspiration and Reognition of Science and Technology, or more commonly known as FIRST, is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization focused on inspiring students and youth in STEM. They organize multiple competitions, each aimed at various age groups. As of 2021, FIRST runs the following programs:

* FIRST LEGO League Discover (Pre-K to Grade 1)
* FIRST LEGO League Explore (Grade 2 to Grade 4)
* FIRST LEGO League Challenge (Grade 4 to Grade 8)
* FIRST Tech Challenge (Grade 7 to Grade 12)
* FIRST Robotics Competition (Grade 9 to Grade 12)

Games and Rules
---------------

Every year, a new game is released. Each game has its own set of objectives. For example, robots during the 2020 game Infinite Recharge shot foam balls to score while robots moved panels and yoga balls in the 2019 game Deep Space.

.. note:: Due to COVID-19, FIRST did not release a new game in 2021.

The new game is usually revealed during the first Saturday of January. The rulebook, a 100+ document, containts all of the game details, including dimensions and scoring methods. As the games are quite different from year to year, a new robot is build each year. To save money though, certain components are often reused.

Build Season and Competition Season
-----------------------------------

To prevent teams from gaining an unfair advantage, FIRST does not allow teams to begin constructing until the release of the rulebook. Due to this rule, the robot should be built in the time between the release of the rulebook and a team's first competition. This period is referred to as "build season".

.. note:: Prior to 2020, teams only had six weeks to complete their robots. Once that six week period had ended, the robot must stop building. For 2020 and later, that rule no longer exists. There is no restriction on the time that teams can work on their robots.

The "competition season" refers to the time period between the first competition and the last competition. Depending on the skill of the team, the last competition will vary.

.. note:: As of 2020, teams can work on their robots between competitions.

Competition Advancement
-----------------------

Included in the registration fee paid each team is the opportunity to attend a competition. Teams based in regions that use district system can attend two district competitions. Other teams can only attend one regional competition. Teams can attend additional competitions if they pay more money. 

.. note:: Team 5549 is based in the Chesapeake, or CHS, region. As CHS follows the district system, our team has the opportunity to attend two competitions.

Regions following Regional System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Depending on the performance of teams at a regional event, they have the opportunity to advance to worlds. According to the 2020 rulebook, only Regional Chairman's Award winners, FIRST Engineering Inspiration Award winners, Regional competition winners, and Wild Card recipients can proceed to the FIRST championship event, or worlds. Wild cards are distributed to the finalist alliance in the order of team selection.

Regions following the District Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For regions that follow district model, teams are given a certain amount of points depending on their competition performance. Points are gained based on qualification rank, alliance selection, playoff performance, and awards. For the full details, view the rulebook. 

Based on the points obtained during the two district competitions, teams can qualify for district champs. For 2020, the top 80 teams in district points would have qualified for district champs. Depending on the performance of the team at district champs, they can progress to the FIRST Championship event, or worlds.
